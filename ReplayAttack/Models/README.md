**replay_attack_net_v3.dat** - trained on rgb images (120 % Dlib's face detector crop) of the slavic faces (about 5000 unique faces) with augmentation, replays were recorded on smartphone glassy display, glassy lcd monitor and another mat monitor. Test accuracy (on hollywood dataset with 255 unique faces) was 96,5 %. Model contains two output neurons, and can generate two output labels: 0 is used as 'live' face label, and 1 used as 'attack' label. Model's architecture definition can be found in appropiate [customnetwork.h](https://github.com/pi-null-mezon/FaceAntiSpoofing/blob/228c90b90d3d93c81415ca2d95b15c447d5a2222/ReplayAttack/Learner/customnetwork.h#L84) file.
